      <h2>Robert E. Lee 1807 – 1870</h2>
      <p>
        Robert Edward Lee (January 19, 1807 – October 12, 1870) was a
        Confederate general during the American Civil War, toward the end of
        which he was appointed the overall commander of the Confederate States
        Army. He led the Army of Northern Virginia—the Confederacy's most
        powerful army—from 1862 until its surrender in 1865, earning a
        reputation as a skilled tactician. A son of Revolutionary War officer
        Henry "Light Horse Harry" Lee III, Lee was a top graduate of the United
        States Military Academy and an exceptional officer and military engineer
        in the United States Army for 32 years. He served across the United
        States, distinguished himself extensively during the Mexican–American
        War, and was Superintendent of the United States Military Academy.  He
        married Mary Anna Custis, great-granddaughter of George Washington's
        wife Martha. While he opposed slavery from a philosophical perspective,
        he supported its legality and held hundreds of slaves. When
        Virginia declared secession from the Union in 1861, Lee chose to follow
        his home state, despite his desire for the country to remain intact and
        an offer of a senior Union command. During the first year of the Civil
        War, he served in minor combat operations and as a senior military
        adviser to Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Lee took command of
        the Army of Northern Virginia in June 1862 during the Peninsula
        Campaign following the wounding of Joseph E. Johnston. He succeeded in
        driving the Union Army of the Potomac under George B. McClellan away
        from the Confederate capital of Richmond during the Seven Days Battles,
        but he was unable to destroy McClellan's army. Lee then overcame Union
        forces under John Pope at the Second Battle of Bull Run in August. His
        invasion of Maryland that September ended with the inconclusive Battle
        of Antietam, after which he retreated to Virginia. Lee won two major
        victories at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville before launching a
        second invasion of the North in the summer of 1863, where he was
        decisively defeated at the Battle of Gettysburg by the Army of the
        Potomac under George Meade. He led his army in the minor and
        inconclusive Bristoe Campaign that fall before General Ulysses S. Grant
        took command of Union armies in the spring of 1864. Grant engaged Lee's
        army in bloody but inconclusive battles at the Wilderness and
        Spotsylvania before the lengthy Siege of Petersburg, which was followed
        in April 1865 by the capture of Richmond and the destruction of most of
        Lee's army, which he finally surrendered to Grant at Appomattox Court
        House. In 1865, Lee became president of Washington College, now
        Washington and Lee University, in Lexington, Virginia; as president of
        the college, he supported reconciliation between the North and South.
        Lee accepted the termination of slavery provided for by the Thirteenth
        Amendment, but opposed racial equality for African Americans. After his
        death in 1870, Lee became a cultural icon in the South and is largely
        hailed as one of the Civil War's greatest generals. As commander of the
        Army of Northern Virginia, he fought most of his battles against armies
        of significantly larger size, and managed to win many of them.
